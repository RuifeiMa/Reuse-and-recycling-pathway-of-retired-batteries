# Reuse-and-recycling-pathway-of-retired-batteries

This accessible roadmap design and evaluation tool focuses on selecting battery retirement scenarios, providing quick access to lifecycle carbon emissions and the economic performance of retired batteries. It enhances traditional life cycle assessment methodologies by streamlining data management, reducing computational power, and facilitating automation and standardization. The tool simplifies sensitivity analysis and uncertainty evaluations. As open-source software, it can inspire further work and extend retirement scenarios, offering benefits to both researchers and communities.

Main1AllDataGeneration.m generates the main data, including the economic performance and carbon footprint across different stages. Main2CarbonFootprint.m, Main3ManufacturingCarbonFootprintDetalis.m, Main4RecyclingCostDetails.m, Main5PathwayCost.m, Main6PathwayCarbonFootprint.m are based on the data processed from Main1AllDataGeneration.m. Therefore, Main1AllDataGeneration.m should be run first, followed by other five files.

Based on this tool, some of the data generated have been published in the paper titled "Pathway Decisions for Reuse and Recycling of Retired Lithium-Ion Batteries Considering Economic and Environmental Functions." If you use the code, please cite this paper. You can access the paper at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-52030-0.
