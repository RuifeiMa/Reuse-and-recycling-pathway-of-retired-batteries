# Reuse-and-recycling-pathway-of-retired-batteries

This accessible roadmap design and evaluation tool focuses on selecting battery retirement scenarios, providing quick access to lifecycle carbon emissions and the economic performance of retired batteries. It enhances traditional life cycle assessment methodologies by streamlining data management, reducing computational power, and facilitating automation and standardization. The tool simplifies sensitivity analysis and uncertainty evaluations. As open-source software, it can inspire further work and extend retirement scenarios, offering benefits to both researchers and communities.

Main1AllDataGeneration.m generates the main data, including the economic performance and carbon footprint across different stages. Main2CarbonFootprint.m, Main3ManufacturingCarbonFootprintDetalis.m, Main4RecyclingCostDetails.m, Main5PathwayCost.m, Main6PathwayCarbonFootprint.m are based on the data processed from Figure1.m. Therefore, Main1AllDataGeneration.m should be run first, followed by other five files.
